# LaTeX-Beamer-Template
This is a template I initially created for my own purposes. However, as I noticed how much time I start spending with it's design and how great it turns out looking, I uploaded it here for everybodys use.

Actually, I am not sure how extensive I will use it, so maybe this little templates was some kind of waste of time. Another reason, why publishing might be a good idea!

Feel free to make of it use or adjust it to your pleasures. Linking this repo is nevertheless appreciated :)
